Rock Paper Scisors is a simple game made in javascript where you as the player choose to play a hand gesture (Rock paper or scissors)

at that point the computer will choose a random number from a range of 0 to 2, each corrisponding a hand gesture as well

at that point the gestures are compared following the winning algorithm (paper wins rock, scissors wins paper, rock wins scissors)

and then the computer decides if the player has lost, won or drawn
